# python-ai-recognition-script

A script I made to analyze images and provide descriptions

This is something that could be used for web accessiblity in automatically generating alt-text for images

## Basic Setup

If you are familiar with Python and know what you're doing

First go here - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation

Once that's setup go here - https://huggingface.co/nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning

Here's some examples

![Picture of a cat with a white background](cat.jpg)

Gives the following description

```
cat.jpg
['a cat sitting on top of a white surface']
```

## In Depth Setup (My Struggle!)

This is if you are NOT familiar with Python and captures my struggle setting up this project!
